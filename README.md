# Emotion-Recognition-System
This repository provides a deep learning project for emotion detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear from facial expressions. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies from requirements.txt, and prepare your dataset in the data/ directory. Train the model with python train.py, evaluate it using python evaluate.py, and make predictions with python predict.py --image path_to_image.

The project includes scripts for training, evaluating, and predicting, with a custom CNN architecture optimized with Adam and categorical cross-entropy loss. Contributions are welcome via Pull Requests. The project is licensed under the MIT License. For questions, please open an issue or contact the maintainer. Acknowledgments to Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV for their support.
